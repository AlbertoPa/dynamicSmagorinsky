Description
    Implementation of the dynamic Smagorinsky model with coefficients cD and
    cI computed as local average of their face values to avoid numerical
    instabilities.
    Negative values of the effective viscosity are removed by clipping it to
    zero (nuSgs is clipped to -nu)

Target platform
    The code is known to work with OpenFOAM 2.0.x., 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x.

    This version of the code does not build against OpenFOAM 1.7.x. The
    latest version compatible with OpenFOAM 1.7.x corresponds to the git
    commit c5b8d5d8a274ba702c68f1be75f31e8f2def81d7.
